# Core_project
In a world increasingly focused on sustainable transportation solutions, our project endeavors to 
revolutionize the electric vehicle (EV) charging landscape with a groundbreaking "Solar Wireless 
Electric Vehicle Charging System." This innovative system, comprising vital components such as 
solar panels, an HF transformer, Arduino microcontroller, LCD display, and battery storage, 
promises to redefine EV charging by providing nonstop access to clean energy.
At the heart of this project lies a carefully designed solar panel array, strategically positioned to 
capture and convert solar energy into a viable power source for EV charging. The HF transformer 
plays a pivotal role in efficiently managing this solar energy, ensuring its compatibility with EVs. 
The Arduino microcontroller, the system's central intelligence, oversees energy distribution, real 
time monitoring, and wireless charging, while the LCD display provides users with vital 
information, such as charging progress and energy savings. To guarantee uninterrupted EV 
charging, especially during the night or under overcast conditions, battery storage has been 
integrated to store surplus solar energy for future use.
This project is poised to provide EV owners with an eco-friendly and autonomous charging 
solution, reducing dependence on conventional power grids and contributing to a cleaner, more 
sustainable future. By harnessing the sun's energy and utilizing advanced technologies, this Solar 
Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging System is set to redefine how EVs are charged, offering an eco-
conscious and continuous charging experience.
